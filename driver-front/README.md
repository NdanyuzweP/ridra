## Key Features

### Authentication
- **Driver-only Access**: Restricted to users with driver role
- **Secure Login**: JWT-based authentication
- **Session Management**: Persistent login with token validation

### Real-time Tracking
- **Location Updates**: Continuous GPS tracking when online
- **Passenger Visibility**: Share location with interested passengers
- **Route Monitoring**: Track progress along assigned routes

### Communication
- **Passenger Interests**: View who wants to board your bus
- **Contact Details**: Access passenger phone and email

### Performance Monitoring
- **Trip Analytics**: Track completed vs scheduled trips
- **Earnings Calculation**: Estimate daily and trip earnings
- **Passenger Metrics**: Monitor interest and confirmation rates

## API Integration

The driver app integrates with the same backend as the passenger app:

- **Authentication**: Driver login and profile management
- **Bus Management**: Assigned bus information and status
- **Location Services**: Real-time location updates
- **Schedule Management**: Trip schedules and timing
- **Passenger Data**: Interested passenger information

## Security Features

- **Role-based Access**: Only drivers can access the app
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT tokens with validation
- **Data Protection**: Encrypted communication with backend
- **Permission Management**: Location and notification permissions

## Development
